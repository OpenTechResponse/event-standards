OpenTechResponse Event Standards
================================

OpenTechResponse is working to build a community hub to coordinate responses to
emergencies for the open technology community.  As part of that effort, OpenTechResponse
is drafting a set of standards to support the community's coordination efforts.

Our first set of standards cover the definition of resource types that can be published,
aggregated, and indexed for volunteer events and matchmaking volunteers to volunteer
opportunities.
